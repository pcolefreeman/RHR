This project was originally completed for extra credit in a Physics two course. 

The code works by taking 5 sequential inputs. The first three inputs take the direction of the vectors of velocity, magnetic field, and force in order, the next input is a boolean value to determine whether the charge being studied is positive or negative, and the last input asks if you would like to run the code again. To determine the direction of any of the given vectors, just leave that input as empty.
